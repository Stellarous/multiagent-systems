# Foundations of Multiagent Systems

Architecting an artificial society requires extensive formalism in both algorithm and modeling. Here I explore different aspects of multiagent systems and their roots in game theory, artificial intelligence, distibuted computing, object-oriented programming, complexity and emergence. The goal is to grow a list of documents that contain formal and informal basis for designing, developing and deploying a multiagent system.
